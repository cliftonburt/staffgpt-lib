from staffgpt.integrations import NotionAPI
from staffgpt.automation import TaskAutomation

# Define an AI role
admin_role = AIRole(name="Admin Assistant", tasks=["Scheduling", "Reporting"])

# Initialize Notion API integration
notion = NotionAPI(api_key="your_notion_api_key")

# Automate task creation in Notion
automation = TaskAutomation(role=admin_role, integration=notion)
automation.create_task(task_name="Prepare weekly report", due_date="2024-10-15")
```

## Integrations

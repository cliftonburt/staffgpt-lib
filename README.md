# StaffGPT Library

**StaffGPT** is a Python library designed to streamline the creation and management of **AI roles**, **task automation**, and **integrations** with popular productivity tools like **Notion**, **ChatGPT**, and **Zapier**. The library is intended to provide developers and productivity enthusiasts with reusable components for building sophisticated AI-driven workflows and background processes.

## Features
- **AI Role Structures**: Define and manage intelligent agents with specialized roles for task assignment, background processes, and workflow automation.
- **Notion and ChatGPT Integrations**: Seamless integration with Notion APIs and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, allowing for dynamic task management and content generation.
- **Task Automation**: Automate common productivity tasks, such as syncing data between Notion, Google Sheets, and other tools.
- **Customizable Workflows**: Build role-based task automation workflows tailored to your specific needs.

## Getting Started

### Installation
You can install the StaffGPT library using pip:

```bash
pip install staffgpt-lib
```

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and install it manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/staffgpt-lib.git
cd staffgpt-lib
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
Here is a simple example of how to define an AI role and automate a Notion task workflow:

```python
from staffgpt.roles import AIRole
from staffgpt.integrations import NotionAPI
from staffgpt.automation import TaskAutomation

# Define an AI role
admin_role = AIRole(name="Admin Assistant", tasks=["Scheduling", "Reporting"])

# Initialize Notion API integration
notion = NotionAPI(api_key="your_notion_api_key")

# Automate task creation in Notion
automation = TaskAutomation(role=admin_role, integration=notion)
automation.create_task(task_name="Prepare weekly report", due_date="2024-10-15")
```

## Integrations

- **Notion API**: Automate task creation, syncing, and reporting between Notion databases and your Python application.
- **ChatGPT**: Integrate ChatGPT for role-based content generation or task prioritization.

## Key Components:
**staffgpt/:** This is the main library folder where all the core logic resides. It's broken into:

*roles.py:* Contains the logic for defining and managing AI roles.

*automation.py:* Handles task automation and workflow logic.

*integrations/:* Contains integrations with third-party services like Notion, ChatGPT, and Google Sheets.

*utils.py:* Helper functions for reusable logic (e.g., data processing, API calls).

**examples/:** Contains example Python scripts that show how to use the StaffGPT library in real-world scenarios.

*notion_integration.py:* How to use the Notion API to automate tasks.

*zapier_automation.py:* Automating workflows using Zapier.

*ai_role_management.py:* Example on how to manage and assign AI roles.

**tests/:** Unit tests to ensure the library works as expected. Each major component (roles, automation, integrations) has its own test file.

**docs/:** Documentation folder that contains detailed guides:

*template-guide.md:* How to use AI role templates effectively.

*integrations-guide.md:* How to set up integrations with third-party services.

*contributing.md:* Guidelines for contributing to the project.

*README.md:*
This file is StaffGPT's front-facing documentation. It includes an introduction, features, installation instructions, examples, and how users can contribute.

*setup.py and requirements.txt:* These files are crucial for packaging and installing the library. setup.py defines the package details, and requirements.txt lists all dependencies (e.g., Notion, OpenAI, etc.).
